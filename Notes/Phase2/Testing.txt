- EF Core InMemory
- Since controllers mainly run LINQ queries against the DbContext, it's best to test actual EF Core behavior instead of mocking.
- Using something like Moq doesn’t reproduce EF behavior because mocked DbSets don’t execute real LINQ-to-Entities logic, while the InMemory provider does.
- We aren’t testing PostgreSQL itself, so using an in-memory EF Core database is faster and more appropriate.

- Steps are (from the API root, not inside the TaxiBoard folder):

- create test project
- add it to the solution file
- add a project reference from the test project to the main API .csproj
- install NuGet packages
- create test directory structure
- add base class or factory for the in-memory DbContext
